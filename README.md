## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate Computer Science student who enjoys building beautiful, efficient solutions — from mobile apps to data dashboards. I’m especially drawn to projects that mix logic with design, and tools that empower people to work smarter. When I’m not coding, I’m probably diving into the next cool tech stack or learning how systems work under the hood.
